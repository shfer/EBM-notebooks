# EBM-notebooks
These are notebooks developed for an undergraduate course called Introduction to Earth's Atmosphere and Climate.  The notebooks introduce latitudinal variation of insolation and longwave radiation, the ice-albedo feedback, and a diffusive approximation for atmospheric energy transport.  In otherwords, a Budyko-Sellers type model.
